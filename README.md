# tricksterjs
A barebones browser-game framework that's 100% client-side - built on top of riot.js

### Why did you make this?
I had no internet access, and I was bored

### What can it do?
As of right now:
- Start a new game
- Save a game's data (JSON) to the user's storage
- Ability to load that game data and come back where you left off
- Show you an annoying error message
- Record stats
- Run on pretty much any toaster that has an updated browser

### Should I use this when making a browser game?
I sincerely recommend you don't

### What external stuffs did you put in this project?
This was built on riot ofc - also added Bootstrap 4.0, although you could quite easily take it out. Nothing else.

### Licence?
Apache 2.0

### Wow, I really want to use this!
Okay... but I did put a lot of procrastination into this, so please leave some credit on my behalf - or even better, buy me a beer or something

### TODO
- Document my code, because I'm a good boy
- Finish the error pop-uppy thingy
