# trickster.js
A barebones browser-game framework that's 100% client-side - built on top of riot.js

### What on Earth possessed you to make this?
A wonderful orgy of boredom, procrastination and a dodgy internet connection

### What can it do?
As of right now:
- Start a new game
- Save a game's data (JSON) to the user's storage
- Ability to load that game data and come back where you left off
- Show you an annoying error message
- Record stats
- Run on pretty much any toaster that has an updated browser

### Client-side? What if hackers steal my code!?!?
At best you can minify everything and hope for the best. Other than that, fair game

### Should I use this when making a browser game?
I sincerely recommend you don't

### What external stuffs did you put in this project?
- riot.js
- Bootstrap 4.0 (You can very easily take this out)

That's it

### Licence?
Apache 2.0

### Wow, I really want to use this!
Power to you my friend... but I did put a lot of procrastination into this, so please leave some credit on my behalf - or even better, buy me a beer or something

### TODO
- Document my code, because I'm a good boy
- Finish the error pop-uppy thingy
- Add some easy RPG templating stuff
- Add functionality for Visual Novel-style cut-scenes and stuff like that
- Make it... you know, pretty
